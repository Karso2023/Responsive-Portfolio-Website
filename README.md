# Responsive Portfolio Website

</div>

<p align="left">
This is my first responsive portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I followed a tutorial guide from YouTube, which you can find <a href="https://youtu.be/ldwlOzRvYOU?si=UwsRVnle73WUvAXm">here</a>.

I have also added some features and enhanced the web security with additional code.

# Features 
- loading animation
